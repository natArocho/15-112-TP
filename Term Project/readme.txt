My term project is a game called Fire Emblem: Carnegie 112. The gameplay is similar to that of the Fire Emblem series of video games,
in the sense that it is a turn based strategy game. In this game, your goal is to eliminate the opposing team in the least amount
of time while having as many units left as possible. Each army has 4 Units: An Archer, Bandit, Soldier, and Mercenary. Each Unit 
uses a different weapon, and certain weapons give an advantage over other weapons (Sword beats Axe, Axe beats Lance, Lance beats
Sword, Bow is neutral). The map is also procedurally generated each time the game is run, so you will most likely be playing a
 different map each time. Maps consist of Field, Sand, Tree, Fort, and Mountain Tiles, each with their own properties.

To run the game, run the MainGame.py file.

The only library that needs to be installed is pygame.

Some useful shortcuts are:
	Press "x" when over a unit to print their stats to the console
	
	Press "t" to toggle displaying time

	Press "z" to toggle displaying the enemy attack range
